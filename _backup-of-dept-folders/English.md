**Vision**  

The LV EL learner is an effective and empathetic communicator who is future ready.  

**Mission**

To equip students with a strong foundation in EL skills for the 21st century and develop a passion for language learning through vibrant and enriching programmes and activities. At Loyang View, we have designed and customised curricula and support programmes to cater to each child’s learning needs and maximise their potential.  
  

**English Language and Literature @ LVSS**

To develop a solid foundation in grammar and vocabulary, hone students’ sensitivity to language use and inculcate critical and inventive thinking skills, our EL and Literature curricula are built on rich print and multimodal materials with imaginative content that engage and stimulate students’ imagination, focusing on effective and impactful communication as well as exploration of character, mood and theme. 

### Signature Programmes
--------------------

**Creative Writing Programme**
  
To hone skills in creative writing, our students took part in creative writing enrichment and embarked on writing projects which stretched their imagination. Through exposure to rich multimodal model texts and writing exercises, they had fun re-imagining classic tales and learnt to apply various stylistic features to make their stories more compelling.

To develop reflective thinking and writing skills, Secondary Four and Five students write personal stories of their achievements in school through process writing. Their works have also been published as a compilation of LVSS Success Stories. For 2021, our pioneer cohort of LVSS students shared their personal reflections on how their experiences at LVSS Student Creed have influenced them significantly.  
  
**Digital Reading Programme: LV e-Reads**  

Developing a healthy appetite for reading is key to strengthening literacy and communication skills. At LVSS, we harness the affordances of technology and leverage our students’ IT savviness to supplement their reading diet with rich digital content. In addition to our physical collection at the library, our students also read and listen to e-books and audio books during Silent Reading period on Thursdays through our digital reading platform, LV e-Reads, via the application Sora (powered by OverDrive).

**Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)**  

To encourage student ownership and instil a passion for learning, as part of the Home-Based Learning initiative, students explored their areas of interest during English lessons and worked on collaborative projects. During the post-exam period in Term 4, they showcased their learning in a variety of ways, through three-dimensional displays, posters and video presentations of their learning processes.

**EL-Lit Week**  

This year, our students had a magical week of fantasy-themed EL and Literature activities during our annual EL-Lit Week. Kicking off the exciting week was our Harry Potter-inspired ‘Who Said This Line’ competition that was hosted by our EL teachers, where each class pitted their listening skills against one another to win attractive prizes. During EL lessons, students participated in quizzes on Shakespeare’s famous quotes, went on a virtual AR literary scavenger hunt, and created visual representations of poetry on mythical creatures and magic. Secondary Two and Three students applied creative thinking to come up with 30-word stories based on pictures on fantasy. Students enjoyed themselves and learnt more about word play and language as a form of creative and artistic expression.

**Post-exam English Language Enrichment**    
  
Ever wondered why English is such a complicated language? Our Secondary One students explored the origins of English language and learnt about various words in the English vocabulary that were borrowed from other languages through their post-exam activity, Round the World in Eighty Minutes.

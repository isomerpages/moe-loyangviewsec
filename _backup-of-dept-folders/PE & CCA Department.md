<h3><strong>Outdoor Education</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Sec 2 Outdoor Adventure Camp (2021)</strong></h4>
<p>The Sec 2 non-residential Camp this year was conducted in school premises
(instead of overnight-camping style) following prevailing SMMs. Despite
the restrictions and constraints, students had fun with the activities
and bonded very well together. With bouldering-wall climbing as one of
the activities in this yearâ€™s edition, participants managed to test their
skills out safely and at the same time having fun with the support of their
Secondary 3 Seniors from CCA Rock-climbing Club.</p>
<p>Check out snippets of their wonderful camp experiences here.</p>

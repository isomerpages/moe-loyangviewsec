<h3><strong>Our Vision, Mission and Values</strong></h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vision</strong> 
<br>Every LV Student a Competent and Confident Problem Solver</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong> 
<br>To provide a vibrant learning environment and joyful learning experiences
for the learning of Mathematics</p>
<p><strong>Values</strong> 
<br>Loyang View Mathematics Department believes that every child is unique
and can learn. All Math teachers are committed to develop our students
to be competent problem solvers.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h3>
<p>Align with the school vision, the department works towards helping our
students to build strong conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and
to nurture them to become competent and confident problem solvers. This
is achieved by providing students the opportunity to learn through exploration,
mathematical discourse and self-directed learning. Beyond the learning
of mathematical concepts and skills proficiency, the development of cognitive
and metacognitive process skills are equally important. Students should
have the opportunities to discuss and articulate ideas to develop mathematical
reasoning skills through presentations and other platforms and apply learnt
concepts through real-world context problems and authentic mathematical
modelling tasks. Students should have the opportunities to think about
their learning through alternative assessments such as performance tasks
and thus, develop their metacognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The department has been planning and designing various programmes to cater
to the different learning needs of the students.&nbsp; The department is
constantly exploring and refining their teaching pedagogy in areas such
as Differentiated Instructions (DI), Assessment and E-Pedagogy to enhance
students’ learning. For instance, teachers to develop teaching packages
leveraging the use of ICT through Students Learning Space (SLS), Ace-Learning
(an E-learning portal in supporting independent and self-directed learning
for lower sec normal stream students) and other ICT tools e.g. GeoGebra,
Desmos, Kahoot for deep learning. The lesson packages are designed in such
a way that it incorporates self-directed and collaborative learning and
elements of DI and AfL are infused so to ensure learners achieve deep learning
by managing and taking ownership for their learning.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Mathematics/ POA Week</strong> 
<br>Each year, we run our inaugural Mathematics and POA Week. During the week,
students were introduced to a wide range of enriching and engaging activities
to deepen their appreciation of Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Read More&gt;</strong> 
<br>The inaugural Math Week was an exciting and engaging experience for everyone.
Students were introduced to Diophantus and were challenged to solve a riddle
set by the Mathematician himself. Students also took part in a LIVE Pi
Recital where they came up on stage to showcase their memory power. Other
highlights of the week included an escape room activity and sudoku competitions.
In addition, students are engaged in solving riddles and puzzles during
the week. The Secondary Three Express students are also given opportunity
to experienced Math Modelling in which they modelled real-life situations
to functions. Through participating in these fun-filled activities with
their peers, students get to apply the mathematical concepts they have
learnt and appreciate that Mathematics is everywhere!</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Trail</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with the department’s vision of developing students into competent
and confident problem solvers, students are given opportunities to take
part in Math Trails at external locations where they learn to apply Mathematical
concepts and skills in authentic settings, as well as a platform to work
together as a team.</p>
<p>In 2023, Secondary Two and Three students participated a Maths trail at
Gardens by the Bay as part of their post examinations activity. The trail
provided opportunities for students to improve their mathematical thinking
outside the classroom. The tasks were assigned to the students via SLS.
Through the tasks, the students also developed their creativity and collaborative
skills as they work in teams to apply mathematical skills to real-world
contexts.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Modelling and Performance Tasks</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition, the curriculum seeks to engage students in the application
of Mathematics in real life situations so to enrich their appreciation
of the subject. For each level, students are required to complete a performance
task as an alternative assessment which focus on the conceptual understanding
of what has been learned. This shifts the focus of assessment from concepts
and skills to include process, metacognition and attitude. Authentic tasks
are given to students to apply concepts and skills learned in Math and
other relevant subjects in their curriculum as well as to work collaboratively
as a team.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Other Matters/Math/task.png">
</div>
<p>In secondary education, students engage in hands-on learning through various
projects. For example, in Secondary One, they work in groups to collect,
categorize, and present data using statistical charts, enhancing their
analytical and communication skills. At other levels, students participate
in interdisciplinary projects like renovating urban farming plots or estimating
costs for repainting with math concepts. In Secondary Three, they apply
mathematics to real-world issues, creating mathematical models, interpreting
solutions, and exploring alternatives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Talent Development Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Talent Development Programme aims to develop mathematical talents
of all levels and streams to appreciate the beauty of Mathematics and hone
their mathematical problem-solving skills through challenging activities.
It is also to cater to the needs of students who have strong foundation
of numeracy and interest in Mathematics and would like to pursue further.
Students are trained for stimulating competitions and participated in various
competitions:</p>

<p><strong>Low Progress Support Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Low Progress Support programme aims to support the learning needs
of students who may need more time to understand concepts taught during
curriculum time. Students will have opportunities to use manipulatives
to help them grasp abstract concepts during the sessions.</p>

<p><em>Students use Algediscs to make sense of Algebra</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Foundation Math Bridging Programme (For Sec 1 only)</strong> 
<br>The programme serves to bridge the learning gaps for students who were
doing Foundation Mathematics in primary school. As the learning of Mathematics
is largely hierarchical in nature, the bridging programme has been carried
out to provide early intervention to level up numeracy so to ensure that
all students would have completed the pre-requisites to continue with the
secondary Mathematics syllabus.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Extended Curriculum</strong> 
<br>A week of extended curriculum is planned for Secondary Three students
in term four during the school vacation. This is to prepare them for the
rigour needed when they proceed to Secondary 4 the following year.</p>

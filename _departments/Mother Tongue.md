<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight is a key annual event for our students.
The programme aims to deepen students' appreciation of the culture, history
and values associated with each language. Through vibrant cultural activities,
the event fosters joy of learning and enhances students' ability to think
critically and express their ideas with confidence, both in written and
spoken forms of their Mother Tongue Languages.</p>

<p>The Audio and Video Challenge is designed to engage students in the fields
of journalism and broadcasting by having them create audio and video recordings
that reflect their research on various themes, such as traditional food,
games, and appreciation for the arts. This project aims to foster creativity,
improve research skills, and allow students to showcase their learning
through quality multimedia content.</p>

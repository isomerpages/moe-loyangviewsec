<p>Our Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camps provide learning experiences
that cannot be replicated in the classroom. They offer authentic contexts
in which students apply what they have learnt from Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) and Outdoor Education in Physical Education (OE in PE)
lessons. The richness and complexity of these experiences, such as</p>
<p>working with their peers to overcome challenges or navigating in a new
environment during a journey, allow them to extend and deepen their learning
from the classroom into real life.</p>

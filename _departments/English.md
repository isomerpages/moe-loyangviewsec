<p>As an extension of the Secondary One English Language and Literature curriculum,
all Secondary One students participate in the Poetry Slam programme to
compose and perform original poems of their own. The programme culminates
in an exciting inter-class Poetry Slam competition where students combine
creativity in language use with stage performance.</p>

<p>Secondary Two students transform into junior playwrights through this
drama enrichment programme. They adapt personal stories into short skits
and inject life to the narratives through an inter-class drama competition.
In the process, students grow in confidence as they perform on stage and
develop greater appreciation for language in theatrical arts.</p>

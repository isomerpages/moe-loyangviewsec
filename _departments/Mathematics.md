<h2><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Align with the school vision, the department works towards helping our
students to build strong conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and
to nurture them to become competent and confident problem solvers. This
is achieved by providing students the opportunity to learn through exploration,
mathematical discourse and self-directed learning. Beyond the learning
of mathematical concepts and skills proficiency, the development of cognitive
and metacognitive process skills are equally important. Students should
have the opportunities to discuss and articulate ideas to develop mathematical
reasoning skills through presentations and other platforms and apply learnt
concepts through real-world context problems and authentic mathematical
modelling tasks. Students should have the opportunities to think about
their learning through alternative assessments such as performance tasks
and thus, develop their metacognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The department has been planning and designing various programmes to cater
to the different learning needs of the students.&nbsp; The department is
constantly exploring and refining their teaching pedagogy in areas such
as Differentiated Instructions (DI), Assessment and E-Pedagogy to enhance
studentsâ€™ learning. For instance, teachers to develop teaching packages
leveraging the use of ICT through Students Learning Space (SLS), Ace-Learning
(an E-learning portal in supporting independent and self-directed learning
for lower sec normal stream students) and other ICT tools e.g. GeoGebra,
Desmos, Kahoot for deep learning. The lesson packages are designed in such
a way that it incorporates self-directed and collaborative learning and
elements of DI and AfL are infused so to ensure learners achieve deep learning
by managing and taking ownership for their learning.</p>

<p>The Mathematics Talent Development Programme aims to develop mathematical
talents in students of all levels and courses to enable them to appreciate
the beauty of Mathematics and hone their mathematical problem-solving skills
through challenging activities. It also aims to inspire students who have
a strong foundation of numeracy and interest in Mathematics to explore
deeper learning and applications of the subject. Through this programme,
students are trained to participate in various exciting competitions:</p>

</div>
<p>Mathematics Week is an annual event where students are introduced to a
wide range of enriching and engaging activities to deepen their appreciation
of Mathematics.</p>
<p>This year's Mathematics Week was an exciting and engaging experience for
everyone. Students took part in a LIVE Factris competition where they went
on stage to showcase their speed and accuracy in a game of Factorization.
Other highlights of the week included an escape room activity and sudoku
competitions. In addition, students had fun solving mathematics riddles
and puzzles. Secondary Three Express students experienced Math Modelling
in which they modelled real-life situations to mathematical functions.
Through participation in these fun-filled activities with their peers,
students get to apply the mathematical concepts they have learnt and appreciate
the importance of Mathematics in everyday life.</p>

</div>
<p>To extend students' learning beyond the classroom, students participate
in Math Trails at Jewel Singapore Changi Airport and Gardens by the Bay.
Through solving real-world context problems on the trails, they learn to
apply Mathematical concepts and skills in authentic settings and develop
collaborative skills through group work.</p>

<p>The Mathematics Talent Development Programme aims to develop mathematical
talents in students of all levels and courses to enable them to appreciate
the beauty of Mathematics and hone their mathematical problem-solving skills
through challenging activities. It also aims to inspire students who have
a strong foundation of numeracy and interest in Mathematics to explore
deeper learning and applications of the subject. Through this programme,
students are trained to participate in various exciting competitions:</p>

<p>Mathematics Week is an annual event where students are introduced to a
wide range of enriching and engaging activities to deepen their appreciation
of Mathematics.</p>
<p>This year's Mathematics Week was an exciting and engaging experience for
everyone. Students took part in a LIVE Factris competition where they went
on stage to showcase their speed and accuracy in a game of Factorization.
Other highlights of the week included an escape room activity and sudoku
competitions. In addition, students had fun solving mathematics riddles
and puzzles. Secondary Three Express students experienced Math Modelling
in which they modelled real-life situations to mathematical functions.
Through participation in these fun-filled activities with their peers,
students get to apply the mathematical concepts they have learnt and appreciate
the importance of Mathematics in everyday life.</p>

<p>To extend students' learning beyond the classroom, students participate
in Math Trails at Jewel Singapore Changi Airport and Gardens by the Bay.
Through solving real-world context problems on the trails, they learn to
apply Mathematical concepts and skills in authentic settings and develop
collaborative skills through group work.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Vision, Mission and Values</strong></h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Every LV Student a Competent and Confident Problem Solver</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>To provide a vibrant learning environment and joyful learning experiences
for the learning of Mathematics</p>
<p><strong>Values</strong>
<br>Loyang View Mathematics Department believes that every child is unique
and can learn. All Math teachers are committed to develop our students
to be competent problem solvers.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h3>
<p>Align with the school vision, the department works towards helping our
students to build strong conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and
to nurture them to become competent and confident problem solvers. This
is achieved by providing students the opportunity to learn through exploration,
mathematical discourse and self-directed learning. Beyond the learning
of mathematical concepts and skills proficiency, the development of cognitive
and metacognitive process skills are equally important. Students should
have the opportunities to discuss and articulate ideas to develop mathematical
reasoning skills through presentations and other platforms and apply learnt
concepts through real-world context problems and authentic mathematical
modelling tasks. Students should have the opportunities to think about
their learning through alternative assessments such as performance tasks
and thus, develop their metacognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The department has been planning and designing various programmes to cater
to the different learning needs of the students.&nbsp; The department is
constantly exploring and refining their teaching pedagogy in areas such
as Differentiated Instructions (DI), Assessment and E-Pedagogy to enhance
students’ learning. For instance, teachers to develop teaching packages
leveraging the use of ICT through Students Learning Space (SLS), Ace-Learning
(an E-learning portal in supporting independent and self-directed learning
for lower sec normal stream students) and other ICT tools e.g. GeoGebra,
Desmos, Kahoot for deep learning. The lesson packages are designed in such
a way that it incorporates self-directed and collaborative learning and
elements of DI and AfL are infused so to ensure learners achieve deep learning
by managing and taking ownership for their learning.</p>

<h3><strong>Mathematics &amp; Additional Mathematics</strong></h3>
<p>The Mathematics curriculum aims to provide students with the fundamental
mathematical knowledge and skills. For Elementary Mathematics, the content
is organised into three strands namely, Number and Algebra, Geometry and
Measurement, and Statistics and Probability.&nbsp; For Additional Mathematics,
the content includes topics such as Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry
and Calculus. The curriculum is broad-based at the lower secondary covering
a wide range of concepts, skills and processes. Upper Secondary students
will be doing a more in-depth study into various strands, going beyond
examination syllabus. This incorporates a variety of learning experiences
such as classroom and online learning, enrichment programmes, outdoor trails
and competition trainings. In general, the Mathematics curriculum is closely
aligned to MOE defined syllabus and includes problem solving heuristics
and application of real-life contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Mathematics syllabus aims to enable all students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire mathematical concepts and skills for continuous learning in mathematics
and to support learning in other subjects.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Principles of Accounts</strong></h3>

<p>an understanding of how accounting information is being presented,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the skills of presenting quantitative accounting information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As users of accounting information, students are to develop</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>an understanding of how accounting information is being used; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the skills of analysing, interpreting and evaluating business performance
and status.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Computer Applications</strong></h3>
<p>The Computer Applications syllabus aims to help students to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acquire skills in using a variety of application software and computer
hardware&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an awareness of how computing technology is used in the home,
school, workplace and community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appreciate the role computers play in everyday life and recognise the
impact computers have on society and people.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides theoretical knowledge, students are also trained in the use of
various softwares to develop their skills in handling documents, spreadsheets
and media content.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Programmes</strong></h3>
<hr>
<p>By leveraging on varied exploratory and experiential learning platforms,
we seek to cater to the diverse learning needs of our students to enable
each of them to achieve his/her fullest potential and cultivate a deep
interest in Math.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have two different types of programmes to cater to the learning needs
of the levels and specific needs of students where required. Our programmes
can be classified as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I)&nbsp;Level Wide Programmes</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II)&nbsp;Special Programmes</p>

<p><strong>(ai)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathematics Fiesta</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance students’ Math learning experiences, Secondary One students
participate in an in-house Math Fiesta where they have fun through playing
Math games and puzzles organised by the seniors.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</p>
<p><strong>(a) Mathematics Talent Development Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Talent Development Programme aims to develop mathematical talents
of all levels and streams to appreciate the beauty of Math through challenging
activities. Students are trained for stimulating competitions and they
participate in various competitions namely;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Mathematics Olympiad (SMO)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Asian Schools Mathematics
Olympiad (SASMO)</p>

<p><strong>(b) Low Progress Support Programme</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Low Progress Support programme aims to support the learning needs
of students who may need more time to understand concepts taught during
curriculum time. Students will have opportunities to use manipulatives
to help them grasp abstract concepts during the sessions.</p>

<p><strong>(c) Foundation Math Bridging Programme (For Sec 1 only)</strong>
</p>
<p>The programme serves to bridge the learning gaps for students who were
doing Foundation Mathematics in primary school. This ensures that all students
would have completed the pre-requisites to continue with the secondary
Mathematics syllabus.</p>

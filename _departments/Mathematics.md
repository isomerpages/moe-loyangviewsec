### Mathematics Programmes
---------------------

By leveraging on varied exploratory and experiential learning platforms, we seek to cater to the diverse learning needs of our students to enable each of them to achieve his/her fullest potential and cultivate a deep interest in Math.

We have two different types of programmes to cater to the learning needs of the levels and specific needs of students where required. Our programmes can be classified as:

     I) Level Wide Programmes

   II) Special Programmes

_Sec 3 Math Trail at Changi Airport_

**b) Mathematics Modelling and Problems in Real World Context Tasks**  

To create opportunities for students to apply concepts and skills learned in Math and other relevant subjects in their curriculum, students work collaboratively to solve real-world problems.

**(II) Special Programmes**

**(a) Mathematics Talent Development Programme**

The Talent Development Programme aims to develop mathematical talents of all levels and streams to appreciate the beauty of Math through challenging activities. Students are trained for stimulating competitions and they participate in various competitions namely;

1.     Singapore Mathematics Olympiad (SMO)

2.     Singapore and Asian Schools Mathematics Olympiad (SASMO)

3.     Australian Mathematics Competition (AMC)

4.     Singapore Mathematics Kangaroo Competition (SMKC)

5.     University of New South Wales Mathematics Competition (UNSW)

**(b) Low Progress Support Programme**  

The Low Progress Support programme aims to support the learning needs of students who may need more time to understand concepts taught during curriculum time. Students will have opportunities to use manipulatives to help them grasp abstract concepts during the sessions.

**(c) Foundation Math Bridging Programme (For Sec 1 only)**

The programme serves to bridge the learning gaps for students who were doing Foundation Mathematics in primary school. This ensures that all students would have completed the pre-requisites to continue with the secondary Mathematics syllabus.

<h3><strong><em>Our Vision, Mission and Values</em></strong></h3>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Vision</em></strong><em> <br>Every LV Student a Competent and Confident Problem Solver</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Mission</em></strong><em> <br>To provide a vibrant learning environment and joyful learning experiences for the learning of Mathematics</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Values</em></strong><em> <br>Loyang View Mathematics Department believes that every child is unique and can learn. All Math teachers are committed to develop our students to be competent problem solvers.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong><em>Department Philosophy</em></strong></h3>
<p><em>Align with the school vision, the department works towards helping our students to build strong conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and to nurture them to become competent and confident problem solvers. This is achieved by providing students the opportunity to learn through exploration, mathematical discourse and self-directed learning. Beyond the learning of mathematical concepts and skills proficiency, the development of cognitive and metacognitive process skills are equally important. Students should have the opportunities to discuss and articulate ideas to develop mathematical reasoning skills through presentations and other platforms and apply learnt concepts through real-world context problems and authentic mathematical modelling tasks. Students should have the opportunities to think about their learning through alternative assessments such as performance tasks and thus, develop their metacognition.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The department has been planning and designing various programmes to cater to the different learning needs of the students.&nbsp; The department is constantly exploring and refining their teaching pedagogy in areas such as Differentiated Instructions (DI), Assessment and E-Pedagogy to enhance students’ learning. For instance, teachers to develop teaching packages leveraging the use of ICT through Students Learning Space (SLS), Ace-Learning (an E-learning portal in supporting independent and self-directed learning for lower sec normal stream students) and other ICT tools e.g. GeoGebra, Desmos, Kahoot for deep learning. The lesson packages are designed in such a way that it incorporates self-directed and collaborative learning and elements of DI and AfL are infused so to ensure learners achieve deep learning by managing and taking ownership for their learning.</em>

<h3><strong><em>Mathematics &amp; Additional Mathematics</em></strong></h3>
<p><em>The Mathematics curriculum aims to provide students with the fundamental mathematical knowledge and skills. For Elementary Mathematics, the content is organised into three strands namely, Number and Algebra, Geometry and Measurement, and Statistics and Probability.&nbsp; For Additional Mathematics, the content includes topics such as Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry and Calculus. The curriculum is broad-based at the lower secondary covering a wide range of concepts, skills and processes. Upper Secondary students will be doing a more in-depth study into various strands, going beyond examination syllabus. This incorporates a variety of learning experiences such as classroom and online learning, enrichment programmes, outdoor trails and competition trainings.

<h4><strong><em>Key Programmes</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Mathematics/ POA Week</em></strong><em> <br>Each year, we run our inaugural Mathematics and POA Week. During the week, students were introduced to a wide range of enriching and engaging activities to deepen their appreciation of Mathematics.</em>
</p>
<p><strong><em>&lt;Read More&gt;</em></strong><em> <br>The inaugural Math Week was an exciting and engaging experience for everyone. Students were introduced to Diophantus and were challenged to solve a riddle set by the Mathematician himself. Students also took part in a LIVE Pi Recital where they came up on stage to showcase their memory power. Other highlights of the week included an escape room activity and sudoku competitions. In addition, students are engaged in solving riddles and puzzles during the week. The Secondary Three Express students are also given opportunity to experienced Math Modelling in which they modelled real-life situations to functions. Through participating in these fun-filled activities with their peers, students get to apply the mathematical concepts they have learnt and appreciate that Mathematics is everywhere!</em>

<p><strong><em>Mathematics Trail</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>In line with the department’s vision of developing students into competent and confident problem solvers, students are given opportunities to take part in Math Trails at external locations where they learn to apply Mathematical concepts and skills in authentic settings, as well as a platform to work together as a team.</em>
</p>
<p><em>In 2023, Secondary Two and Three students participated a Maths trail at Gardens by the Bay as part of their post examinations activity. The trail provided opportunities for students to improve their mathematical thinking outside the classroom. The tasks were assigned to the students via SLS. Through the tasks, the students also developed their creativity and collaborative skills as they work in teams to apply mathematical skills to real-world contexts.</em>

</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Modelling and Performance Tasks</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition, the curriculum seeks to engage students in the application
of Mathematics in real life situations so to enrich their appreciation
of the subject. For each level, students are required to complete a performance
task as an alternative assessment which focus on the conceptual understanding
of what has been learned. This shifts the focus of assessment from concepts
and skills to include process, metacognition and attitude. Authentic tasks
are given to students to apply concepts and skills learned in Math and
other relevant subjects in their curriculum as well as to work collaboratively
as a team.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Other Matters/Math/task.png">
</div>
<p>In secondary education, students engage in hands-on learning through various
projects. For example, in Secondary One, they work in groups to collect,
categorize, and present data using statistical charts, enhancing their
analytical and communication skills. At other levels, students participate
in interdisciplinary projects like renovating urban farming plots or estimating
costs for repainting with math concepts. In Secondary Three, they apply
mathematics to real-world issues, creating mathematical models, interpreting
solutions, and exploring alternatives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Talent Development Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Talent Development Programme aims to develop mathematical talents
of all levels and streams to appreciate the beauty of Mathematics and hone
their mathematical problem-solving skills through challenging activities.
It is also to cater to the needs of students who have strong foundation
of numeracy and interest in Mathematics and would like to pursue further.
Students are trained for stimulating competitions and participated in various
competitions:</p>

<p><strong>Low Progress Support Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Low Progress Support programme aims to support the learning needs
of students who may need more time to understand concepts taught during
curriculum time. Students will have opportunities to use manipulatives
to help them grasp abstract concepts during the sessions.</p>

<p><em>Students use Algediscs to make sense of Algebra</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Foundation Math Bridging Programme (For Sec 1 only)</strong>
<br>The programme serves to bridge the learning gaps for students who were
doing Foundation Mathematics in primary school. As the learning of Mathematics
is largely hierarchical in nature, the bridging programme has been carried
out to provide early intervention to level up numeracy so to ensure that
all students would have completed the pre-requisites to continue with the
secondary Mathematics syllabus.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Extended Curriculum</strong>
<br>A week of extended curriculum is planned for Secondary Three students
in term four during the school vacation. This is to prepare them for the
rigour needed when they proceed to Secondary 4 the following year.</p>

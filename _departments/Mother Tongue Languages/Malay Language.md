### Malay Journalism & Broadcasting (J&B) Programme
-----------------------------------------------

This programme that started in 2019 hoped to enthuse students’ interest in the areas of Journalism and Broadcasting as well as enhance spoken interaction skills among students. During the Mother Tongue Fortnight, the Sec 1 Malay students put these skills to good use by producing an audio recording to advertise their Malay traditional food products while the Sec 2 Malay students created a video related to Malay traditional games. 

  

Here’s some examples of students’ work:



In addition to that, the Sec 1 students had a hands-on session where they learnt how to make epok-epok using plasticine. They then feasted on real epok-epok and ondeh-ondeh provided by the school.

Secondary 2 students challenged each other when they played some traditional games such as congkak, capteh and five stones.  
  
In Term 4, Secondary 1 students were introduced to batik and for their hands-on activity, they painted batik masks.   
  
Secondary 2 students participated in sewing their own five stones after learning about Malay traditional games.

### Hari Raya Celebration
---------------------

Since Hari Raya Aidilfitri was celebrated at home, the school organised a Kahoot quiz via Zoom. Prior to that, students dedicated Hari Raya greetings to one another by giving each other Hari Raya cards.

Students contributed some creative ideas via the Student Learning Space (SLS) during the Home-Based Learning (HBL) period. They doodled characters based on a song, crafted poems about the Covid-19 situation and also dedicated some Hari Raya e-Card messages to their peers.

### 3E Tangkas Terjemah (Swift Translator Competition)
--------------------------------------------------

On Friday, 29 March 2019, our Sec 3 Express students participated in a Malay Language competition ‘Tangkas Terjemah’ (Swift Translator) organised by Meridian Secondary School (Cluster). The competition challenged students’ capacity to be effectively bilingual as they are required to translate words or phrases and texts from Malay to English and vice versa. Our students did us proud to win the 3rd placing, with Swiss Cottage Secondary School in 1st place and Hillgrove Secondary School in 2nd place.

### Deepavali Celebration 2021
--------------------------

Festivals are an expressive way to celebrate glorious heritage, culture and traditions. They are meant to rejoice special moments and emotions in our lives with our loved ones. They play an important role to add structure to our social lives, and connect us with our families and backgrounds.

  

Deepavali is celebrated by many Hindus observing the festival with social gatherings and food offerings to the gods at home and in temples throughout Singapore. 

  

In Loyang View Secondary School, we celebrate Deepavali in a unique way. Secondary One Students were involved in making a simple Deepavali Lamps with the usage of clay. 

  

Teachers also shared with students the meaning of Deepavali and why Hindus all over the world celebrate the festival. This sharing by teachers helps the younger generation to better understand and appreciate the common features shared by the different communities and foster a stronger sense of shared identity as Singaporeans. It also helps promote social cohesion and racial harmony in a multi-racial and multicultural society like Singapore.

Our Tamil students from Sec 1 to Sec 3 participated in ‘NAANUM ORU PADAIPPAALI’ Programme (Budding Writers’ and Artistes’ Programme) that was organised by MOE, Tamil Language Unit of the Mother Tongue Languages Branch, Curriculum Planning and Development Division in 2019. The programme provided an opportunity for our students to explore their talents and flare for writing. It exposed our students to local writers and scriptwriters to equip them with literary and creative writing techniques. It harnessed the synergy across community partners and agencies to nurture the passion in our students for creating local literary works of quality and to ensure a continued pipeline of local writers in Tamil Language.

Our Secondary 2 students went to the Tamil Language Learning Festival at Umar Pulavar Language Centre (UPTLC). They participated in a  lot of language activities and Tamil cultural activities. The event provided a platform for the students to be engaged in a variety of activities pertaining to the Tamil Language and culture. It created opportunities for them to appreciate and understand the richness of the Tamil language and culture in an authentic Tamil environment.

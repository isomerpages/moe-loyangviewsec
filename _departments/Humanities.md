<h2><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Humanities Department believes that every child is unique and can
learn. We aim to hone our students’ critical thinking skills and inculcate
values of good citizens to develop them into wholesome individuals through
our Humanities curriculum. The Humanities teachers promote students’ passion
for Humanities and joy of learning through designing lessons and activities
which are relevant, appealing and personal, as well as aligned to the curriculum
objectives.</p>

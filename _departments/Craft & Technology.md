<p>LVSS Kaleidoscope is a biennial showcase of student talent and passion
in the visual, culinary, literary and performing arts. First held in 2024,
the inaugural event was packed with excitement, featuring performances
from our dance, drama, and symphonic band CCAs, along with a scintillating
performance from the school’s pop-rock band, The 8th Continent, and Music
students. We also had a lively poetry slam, an exhibition showcasing stunning
artwork, live mural drawing in action, and culinary stations serving up
delicious treats. It was a true feast for the senses!</p>

<p>To be launched in 2025, The Spotlight programme is our talent development
programme for students with a passion for art, music, and performance.
It brings together our ongoing efforts to nurture and elevate students’
talents in these fields. Those in The Spotlight can look forward to an
exciting three-year journey designed to help them build technical confidence,
master their craft, and communicate powerfully—both through words and their
art, in the process discovering and expressing their own unique creative
voices.</p>

<h2><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate and
to provide students with strong Science foundation to innovate and pursue
STEM for future learning and work.</p>
<p>Our Science Department’s direction is driven by the Inquiry-Based Learning
Approach, with teachers being the leaders of inquiry, within and outside
the Science classroom. Teachers facilitate the learning of Science by constantly
arousing students’ curiosity about the world and guiding them in the construction
of new knowledge.</p>
<p>With this, we seek <em>to develop in every student the passion and joy of learning Science</em>.</p>

<p>To ignite a passion for Science among our Secondary One students, we offer
students a unique and engaging experience at the Science Centre. Through
this programme, students not only get to explore the diverse and fascinating
exhibits at the Science Centre but also develop crucial skills in collaboration
and effective communication. As they work together to solve challenges
and uncover the secrets of the exhibits, they gain insights that extend
beyond conventional curriculum. This hands-on experience promises to spark
curiosity and enthusiasm for Science learning, fostering a deeper appreciation
and understanding of the subject in a fun and memorable way.</p>

<p>Each year, all Secondary Two students embark on an exciting quest to tackle
a unique challenge designed by Science teachers. With a new challenge each
year, students have the opportunity to engage in creative problem-solving
and practical application of scientific principles. As students work together
to devise and implement their solutions, they not only showcase their creativity
but also gain a deeper understanding of the scientific concepts that underpin
their designs, while acquiring skills in innovation, teamwork and effective
communication.</p>

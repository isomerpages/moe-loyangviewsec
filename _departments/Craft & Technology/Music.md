### Joy of Music @ LVSS
-------------------

To instill the passion of music in students, a variety of programmes such as organising recording studio exposure, morning assembly programmes, music camp, external performances, learning different instruments through our enrichment programmes are implemented. These allow students to develop awareness and appreciation of music.

1.     **Joy of Music to the community**

Students expose to hip hop beatbox music and a singing performance by the Skratch company.

2.     **Sec 1 Music Learning Journey**

Our Secondary 1 students went for an Indian music learning journey. The learning journey is in line with our blended learning approach for lower secondary music. The students had an eye-opening experience as they watched live demonstrations by professional artistes in an Indian fine arts school, and had opportunities to try each of the instruments.

3.     **Be Like a Pro in Audio Production**

Our students learn the different stages of audio production, recognise the elements of sound as well as the use of recording software to set up a recording session to record their performances.

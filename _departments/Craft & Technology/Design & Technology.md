Design & Technology
===================

### Joy of D&T @ LVSS
-----------------

Our D&T curriculum ensures that students are engaged in fun design-and-make activities and experience a basic process of design adapted to their abilities, interest and design context.

1.     **Joy of Developing Entrepreneurship Workshop**

During the ‘Joy of Developing Entrepreneurship through Design’, students were exposed to  various design techniques and apply these skills to communicate their ideas through design works. They developed qualities and values that empower them to reflect and express their ideas through the lens of an entrepreneur.

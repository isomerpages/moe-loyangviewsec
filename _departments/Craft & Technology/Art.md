### Joy of Art @ LVSS
-----------------

Through positive learning experiences in art, students grow to become passionate in Art as they learn that Art beautifies, captures memories, communicates ideas, imparts values and evokes emotions.

1. **Ceramic Programmes**

Our volunteer, Ex-MP Mdm Cynthia Phua conducted a series of Ceramic Workshops for different groups of students to inspire them on the love of ceramic making. Students are inspired by her passion.

Besides that, the secondary 3 art students get to learn acrylic painting conducted by avid artist Mr David Chan. Our Art teacher was also invited to share with other Art teachers during the Art Curriculum Workshop.

4. **Invigorating Assembly Programmes**

"Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together. And great things are not accidental, but must certainly be willed." ~ Vincent van Gogh

Students were exposed to the beautiful art of marbling during morning assembly.

Smart Electrical Technology
===========================

This MOE-ITE applied subject is offered to Normal (Technical) students for a two-year course at the upper secondary level that aims to provide students with training in the core, foundational concepts and principles of electrical circuitry and operation of home automation systems.

Loyang View is one of the six schools in Singapore offering the subject in 2018. Students taking the subject will be sitting for their first GCE N-Level practical examinations paper (Paper 2) for the subject in Secondary Three, the written theory paper (Paper 1) and another practical examinations paper (Paper 3) at the end of Secondary Four. This arrangement allows the students to focus more on the concepts in training for the year and boosts their preparation with a timely assessment of their competency at the end of the year.

Students will also be provided with foundational training in electrical circuits and technology in the applied subject. For home automation, students will learn, through a combination of theory lessons and hands-on practical training, the most commonly used basic and advanced control functions.

The training in electrical circuits and home automation systems will help prepare and enable students to take up further studies in electrical, control and computer engineering or related fields at post-secondary level and forge ahead in the new IT-savvy future of a Smart Nation, where our students can be part of the team that can harness the technology around us and use them to empowered people into leading meaningful and fulfilled lives.

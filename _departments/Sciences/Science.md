### About Science Department


_Vision – Every LV Student to have a strong foundation in Science for life, learning, citizenry and work._

To enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate and to provide students with strong Science foundation to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

Our Science Department’s direction is driven by the Inquiry-Based Learning Approach, with teachers being the leaders of inquiry, within and outside the Science classroom. Teachers facilitate the learning of Science by constantly arousing students’ curiosity about the world and guiding them in the construction of new knowledge.&nbsp;

With this, we seek&nbsp;_to develop in every student the passion and joy of learning Science._


PROGRAMMES &amp; ACTIVITIES
-----------------------

#### ECO-TREK @ Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (SBWR)

ECO-TREK @ SBWR is one key programme for our lower Secondary students. Here, students are taken for an eco-trek into the heart of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (SBWR). The slogan - “bringing our science textbook to life” – best sums up the objectives of this activity. This learning journey into the mangroves aims to integrate the curriculum-based content with a first-hand experience of our natural heritage and create environmental awareness amongst our students. Management of oneself in the nature reserve, using the five senses to experience and gathering information on mangrove flora and fauna are just some of the skills a student would be trained during this activity.&nbsp;

The learning journey of the students does not end after the departure from the wetland reserves. Upon completion of the eco-trek, students integrate ICT in their assignment to showcase their knowledge in a photo story.

#### Science Challenge

Our Science Challenge is one of our key department activities for our Secondary Two students. It challenges our students to apply scientific knowledge in solving novel problems. The challenge aims to develop our students to be lifelong and passionate leaners and be more interested in science. The challenge also cultivates team-spiritedness among our students and develops them in their socio-emotional skills.

Students work together in teams to complete their challenge. For some of the activities, they used commonly found household items to design and build their own Vortex suspension objects, bottle rockets, balancing bikes, air cannon, catapults, paper stools and parachutes. As the students applied what they had learnt in their science lessons, many fascinated faces could be seen as the students tested their prototypes to see whether they would succeed.

  

Some of the stations for the challenge included

  

1\. Vortex Suspension - suspend an object at a designated height on top of a fan

Purpose&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students learn to balance objects though the use of Physics of aerodynamics and Newton’s Law through trial and error as this simulates indoor skydiving

  

2\. Air cannon - design an air cannon that can hit the target over a distance using air as a projectile

Purpose&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students learn to appreciate the transfer of energy in the process, learn that air has mass and hence can exert a force over a distance despite it being invisible to the eye!

  

3\. Projectile launcher - build a machine that can launch a ping pong ball over the greatest distance.

Purpose&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students learn about projectile motion of objects and the energy conversion.

  

4\. Chemical powered Rocket - use chemicals to power a bottle to a fixed distance.

Purpose&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students learn to quantify the chemicals used and discover the propulsion method using pressure!

  

5\. Parachute - build parachute to safely land an egg from 2 storeys

Purpose&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students learn to apply the material science in plastic bags and strings to build a unique parachute to combat against gravity.

  

6\. Paper stool – build a stool out of newspaper and ensure it can support the weight of a person.

Purpose&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students learn to apply the material science in newspaper and to build a unique stool to combat against the force due to gravity.

  

7\. Balancing bike – build bike that can balance on a tight rope and can reach the end in the shortest amount of time.

Purpose&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students learn to apply the material science in sticks and to build a unique bike that can balance itself and race.

#### **WORKSHOPS &amp; ENRICHMENT PROGRAMMES**

To enrich their learning of Science beyond the curriculum, students attend workshops or enrichment programmes in school or those conducted by other institutions.

**Biology Enrichment Programme**

In 2019, the Secondary Four Pure Biology and Three Science (Biology) students went to the Singapore Science Centre for a hands-on experience of&nbsp;Genetic Engineering techniques to complement their theory lesson on Genetic Engineering.

Students learnt to apply their knowledge of genetic engineering in the practical session. This session allowed the students to appreciate the methods used by scientists to create transgenic organisms for medical purposes. In addition, students learnt the sterile laboratory techniques to work with bacteria, including growing bacteria colonies via plating.

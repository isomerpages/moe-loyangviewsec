**CCE in Loyang View**

Our vision for CCE is to nurture confident and self-directed citizens with robust character who contribute to the betterment of community and the world. Through providing quality character and citizenship education, we aim to achieve our desired outcomes of developing our students to be wholesome individuals with **Integrity, Respect, Resilience & Compassion**.

CCE programmes and activities are designed to achieve objectives in these 4 areas:   

*   To develop qualities and values that define a civilised society
*   To develop competencies and values for survival in the 21st century workforce
*   To promote unity, social cohesion and student engagement in the community
*   To promote nationhood and a shared identity

  
CCE is delivered through lessons during curriculum time, infused in academic and non-academic areas, engaging students in CCA programmes and other enrichment activities, use of specially designed lesson packages and celebration of the core NE events (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, Kindness Day and National Day).

##### Signature Programmes 

**Invigorating Morning Assembly**

Exciting, Engaging and Enriching programmes are planned every morning between 7.20am -7.50am so students can look forward to something interesting to pique their curiosity everyday,

**Farmers’ Market**

Our Lower Sec students adopt plots of land within the school compound and regularly tend to the vegetation and plants grown in the allocated areas. These fresh veggies and produce are later packaged, turned into delectable goodies and sold by the students. This imbues public-spiritedness and immerses them in innovative ventures as they tap on their entrepreneurship skills to market their products.

**FutureForward Skills Workshop**

The FutureForward Skills Workshop is organised for graduating classes. The intent is to enrich minds, instil confidence and increase the motivation level of students through transforming mindsets and attitudes to pursue meaningful success. It also aims to equip students with practical skill sets for the future work place – how to ace the interview and make informed decisions for career planning
so they become socially confident and pursue success with passion for learning.

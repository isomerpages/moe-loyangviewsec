CHARACTER & CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION
===

## Overview  
##### CCE is key to our vision of developing our students as future-ready leaders and active citizens, to lead purposeful lives with robust character so they contribute actively to the community, persevere through challenges, exemplify the school values of Integrity, Respect, Resilience, Responsibility & Compassion. and inspire others.

##### With reference to MOE CCE 2021 framework and undergirded by ‘Relevant, Appealing, Personal' as a pedagogical guideline, our CCE lessons are designed based on the Clarify–Sensitise–Influence (CSI) frame for asking questions that help students develop their self-awareness, reflection, and empathy. The teacher intentionally guides the thought process of students to provide a platform for them to practise and to internalise sound values in self-management and decision making. Through this process, students are guided to take greater ownership of their decisions and opinions.

### **Signature 2: Caught-In-The Act**

#### Our school is committed to fostering an environment where students are encouraged to develop the moral courage needed to make values-based decisions, no matter the circumstances they face. This commitment extends to recognising and affirming students who embody the school's core values and demonstrate exemplary character through termly nominations by staff and peers. By doing so, we aim to promote a culture of integrity and respect, highlighting and celebrating positive behaviour as a model for others to follow.

### Signature 3: Champion Class Awards


##### The inter-class champion awards are designed to foster a positive class culture and provide students with opportunities to feel a strong sense of belonging within the school community. These awards encourage healthy competition and collaboration among different classes, creating an environment where students can celebrate their achievements together. By participating in various challenges and activities, students not only strive for excellence but also develop bonds of camaraderie and mutual respect. This initiative helps to instill pride in their class identity while reinforcing values such as teamwork, perseverance, and school spirit, ultimately nurturing an inclusive, vibrant and supportive atmosphere throughout the school.

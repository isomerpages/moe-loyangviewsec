<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyber Wellness in LVSS is based on a comprehensive programme &nbsp;to
develop Loyang View students into discerning and responsible ICT users
who are able to protect themselves and be responsible for their well-being
in cyberspace. Through CCE lessons as well as cyberwellness activities
such as Assembly Talks, Workshops, Parent Talks&nbsp; conducted in our
school, our students learn to be respectful, safe and responsible users
of technology, be a positive peer influence, advocate positive use of technology
for the good of the community and acquire practical tips on protecting
oneself and others from harmful online behaviours.
<br>
<br>Our Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) are also involved in fostering cyber wellness
by promoting healthy and responsible online behavior. We prioritise empowering
our student leaders to stay updated on current digital trends to proactively
guide their peers in making thoughtful and informed choices in the digital
world.
<br>
<br>The school adopts MOEâ€™s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students
on Cyber Wellness. This framework focuses on three key processes: Sense,
Think and Act.</p>

Cyber Wellness Programme
========================

Loyang View uses the MOE Cyber Wellness curriculum to equip students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible users of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).   
  
Students adopt the learning cycle of “Sense, Think and Act” to become safe and responsible users of ICT: 

  
Sense – To be aware of the risks of harmful behaviours online and learn how to manage such risks as well as protect themselves from the dangers   
Think – To analyse, evaluate and reflect on cyber wellness issues so as to respond to new encounters in cyberspace   
Act – To translate understanding into actions that keep them safe while online

Other than lessons conducted in class on cyber wellness, there are assembly programmes and other activities e.g. watching plays, which reinforce the messages of safety, respect and responsibility in the cyber world.

<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>National Education, a significant aspect of CCE, comprises a wide range
of school efforts that help our students experience and explore their national
identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique
to our nation, and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore. Through
the NE activities and programmes in Loyang View, we instill a strong sense
of belonging, reality, and hope that motivates our students to be active
citizens.</p>

<h2><strong>Signature Programmes</strong></h2>
<h3>Total Defence Day Commemoration</h3>
<p>Through commemorative activities, we equip our students with knowledge
and understanding on the continuing relevance of the six pillars of Total
Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence,
Digital Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core message
of every Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to protect
Singapore and our shared way of life. Sharing personal stories and anecdotes
in relation to key messages on TDD commemoration helps our students make
clear connections to how Total Defence can be practised in everyday life.</p>

<h3>International Friendship Day Commemoration</h3>
<p>Our students are sensitised to Singapore’s geopolitical realities and
are prompted to reflect on the importance of an active foreign policy to
maintain Singapore’s international space, openness to the international
flow of trade, ideas and talent as well as friendship and collaboration
amongst different countries through engaging hands-on activities and discussions
based on thought-provoking case studies.</p>

<h3>Racial Harmony Day Commemoration</h3>
<p>We provide students with the opportunity to reflect on and celebrate Singapore
as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures by emphasising
the collaborative effort of all to promote social cohesion. This is done
through discussions based on authentic case scenarios, assembly presentations
to increase cultural awareness and other commemorative activities as they
bond as a class in their various ethnic attire.</p>

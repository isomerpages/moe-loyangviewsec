NE Commemorative Events
=======================

In Loyang View Secondary School, NE related inter-class activities are planned, to engage our students in commemorating the various NE events. These activities are conducted along with using the commemorative lesson packages and special edition of The Straits Times’ IN newspapers to facilitate CCE lesson discussions on NE messages and issues. 

  

With an inter-class competitive element, these activities bring out the best in every student – to reflect on the messages behind each event and to share their learning with one another.

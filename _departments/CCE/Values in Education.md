<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Our VIA programmes primarily aim to nurture a sense of social responsibility
and enhance our students’ emerging 21st Century Competencies, so our students
become active citizens who:</p>
<p>a) exhibit public-spiritedness and social responsibility</p>
<p>b) translate Loyang View core values into practice</p>
<p>c) are proactive at leading community services and</p>
<p>d) are innovative at providing meaningful services that meet the needs
of the community</p>
<p>We adopt a comprehensive VIA Framework based on a 4‘A’ [Awareness, Action,
Advocacy, Assessment] approach to support the development of character
traits like compassion, responsibility, respect, resilience and integrity.
There is also a thematic approach to the planning and implementation of
VIA programmes to enable progressive development of contribution and values
aligned to respective cohort focus.</p>

<h2><strong>Signature Programmes</strong></h2>
<h3>Serving Society (Sec 1) - Visits to Lion Befriender Homes</h3>
<p>Our Secondary 1 students engage with the elderly from Lion Befrienders
Homes as part of their Values-in-Action (VIA) project. This activity is
specially organised for our students to provide them with opportunities
to connect with our elderly and gain valuable experiences through organising
activities for them and interacting with them. Students share their reflections
gleaned from this experience through an exhibit set-up coupled with presentations
at the end of their visits.</p>

<h3>Championing Environment Causes (Sec 2) - Urban Farming and Farmers' &amp; Makers' Market</h3>
<p>Our Secondary 2 students are involved in the planting and harvesting of
vegetables in our school urban farms. This authentic experience creates
opportunity for our students to develop their resilience, as well as acquire
knowledge on the importance of food security.

<h3>Connecting with Community (Sec 3) - Class Initiated VIA for Select Beneficiary</h3>
<p>Our Secondary 3 students source for a suitable partner-organisation hat
match their class interest for community service. Hence, the selected organisations
serve different beneficiaries and are dependant on the cause that the class
would like to champion for. Some of these organisations include Food Bank,
Willing Hearts, Cat Welfare Society and NTUC Senior Day Care. This helps
to deepen students’ understanding of various needs and concerns in our
community as well as build empathy. To develop students as advocates to
inspire and influence others to make a positive difference, they share
their learning gleaned from the planning to the enactment through an assembly
presentation to their peers.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Social Infrastructure (Sec 4&amp;5) - CNY Community Outreach</h3>
<p>Our graduating students are involved in making Chinese New Year tokens
largely using recycled materials which are given out to the residents in
the neighbourhood. This rich authentic learning experience aims to encourage
students’ voice, create opportunities for adaptive and inventive thinking
and build confidence in effective communication as they engage with the
community in the neighbourhood.</p>

Values in Education
===================

At the end of their secondary school education, Loyang View students will become active citizens who: 

*   exhibit public-spiritedness and social responsibility
*   translate Loyang View core values into practice
*   are proactive at leading community services and
*   are innovative at providing effective services that meet the needs of the community

  

**3 Service Foci and 4 levels of Service:** 

The 3 service foci are ACTION, AWARENESS and ADVOCACY. 

Secondary One students focus on ACTION - taking action to improve a situation they care about. 

Secondary Two to Five students focus on both ACTION and AWARENESS (promoting awareness so that others may learn about an important issue/concern in the community). 

This action-oriented, authentic learning encourages students to use knowledge meaningfully across disciplines and become actively engaged in their education. Students recognise, address, and overcome obstacles as they work together to make a positive difference in the community. It allows students to move from ideas to action. 

VIA Ambassadors/CCA leaders/Student Councillors focus on ADVOCACY, in addition to ACTION and AWARENESS. As they lead teams to work on projects, they play the roles of advocates, inspiring and influencing others to make a difference to something important that they care about. 

**Themes and Choice of Community Partners:**

The level themes and choice of community partners are selected with the spiral progression developmental approach in mind.

As a school keen on building strong home-school partnerships, Loyang View Secondary School is proud have embarked on Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) since 2019 in place of the Family Matters @ School (FMS) Programme.   

  

Supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), the main objectives of the Triple P are to support parents in their journey towards building a confident and resilient child, and strengthening the parent-child relationship.   

  

From 2020, MSF has appointed Methodist Welfare Services (MWS) to support parents in Loyang View Secondary School

# Travel Declaration

Dear Parents/Guardian(s),  
If your child is travelling, kindly submit your travel plan using [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdg0h141_L3r0yoEqCOxwr4SuPCjnPZDTN0zWwBxshdGOidCw/viewform) online form.  
  
Note:  
1) The school strongly discourages Leave of Absence during the school term. However, for specially approved cases that requires your child to leave Singapore, you will be required to declare your childâ€™s travel plans through the online Student Travel Declaration.  
  
2) Where possible, please provide details of country and date of transit if your child/ward will be stopping over at any other country while travelling.  
  
3) Should there be any last minute decision to travel or changes to the original travel plan, kindly resubmit the travel plan before departure.

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>At Loyang View Secondary School, we believe that every basketball player
is unique and has the potential to excel. Even though a player can quickly
acquire the basic skills to play basketball, becoming a truly skilled player
takes a lot of discipline and dedication. Therefore, having the right motivation
is our key ingredient to continuously keep improving our players’ basketball
skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>“I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.”</em>
</p>
<p>- Michael Jordan</p>
<p>During our training, the basketball team focuses both on the athletic
aspects of the sport as well as on character building, leadership and sportsmanship.
Values such as resilience, integrity and respect are instilled in every
player throughout all our activities. Besides training, our players also
have their share of fun during annual camps and team building activities
to foster team spirit and strong camaraderie in the team.</p>

<h4>Reflections</h4>
<p>Being the Captain for B Division 2024 and next year 2025 I can say without
a doubt that Loyang View’s basketball has improved over the 3 years I have
been in this school. This is thanks to the amazing support the team gets
from the teachers Mr. Clement, Mr. Chua, Mr. Melky and Coach Mao Hai Bin.
They guided us to be the best basketball players that we can be. They make
sure we give our all during CCA&nbsp; as well as care for us when we are
feeling frustrated during games and trainings. Besides basketball, we have
camps, barbecue and other enrichment activities that help bond the team
together and create memories. My Goal for next year is that the team will
persevere and be resilient in the face of difficulties so we can bring
back a trophy for Loyang View Secondary school. When I step off as captain
next year, I hope my juniors will still strive towards winning more trophies
for Loyang View. Furthermore, I hope they grow a passion for the sport
and aspire to play at a higher level even after secondary school. Basketball
teaches you important lifelong values.</p>

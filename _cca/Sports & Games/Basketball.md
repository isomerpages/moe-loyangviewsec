<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>At Loyang View Secondary School, we believe that every basketball player
is unique and has the potential to excel. Even though a player can quickly
acquire the basic skills to play basketball, becoming a truly skilled player
takes a lot of discipline and dedication. Therefore, having the right motivation
is our key ingredient to continuously keep improving our players’ basketball
skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>“I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.”</em>
</p>
<p>- Michael Jordan</p>
<p>During our training, the basketball team focuses both on the athletic
aspects of the sport as well as on character building, leadership and sportsmanship.
Values such as resilience, integrity and respect are instilled in every
player throughout all our activities. Besides training, our players also
have their share of fun during annual camps and team building activities
to foster team spirit and strong camaraderie in the team.</p>

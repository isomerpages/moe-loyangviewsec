<h1>InfoComm Club</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr>
<p>The InfoComm Club (IFC) is a merger of AV (Audio Visual) and PVC (Photography
and Videography). It is an exciting and dynamic Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA) that focuses on the ever-evolving world of information and communications
technology (ICT). In this club, students are taught how to set up the audio
visual equipments required for school events and how to capture the world
through their lens. The club also provides students opportunities to explore
and develop skills in other aspects of technology, such as coding and digital
media production. As the digital landscape continues to grow, the InfoComm
Club serves as a platform to foster creativity, technical expertise, and
teamwork among students who are passionate about technology</p>

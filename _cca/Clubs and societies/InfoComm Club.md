Managed by a team of vibrant&nbsp;and dynamic teachers and aimed at leveraging technology for intellectual and&nbsp;social development, the club charts the course for the membersâ€™ infoComm &nbsp;development, so that the school can effectively harness the opportunities presented&nbsp;by the emerging technologies and developments.&nbsp;There will also be many opportunities for the members to entrust themselves&nbsp;with the multi-disciplinary activities and tasks around infoComm that will become&nbsp;the key focus. The club will also continue to develop interesting and relevant&nbsp;training programmes to help the members keep themselves abreast of future&nbsp;infoComm directions and trends, identify opportunities and strengthen its edge,&nbsp;thus leveraging technology to make teaching, learning and co-curricular activities more pervasive and conducive in a Smart School.&nbsp;These training activities include photography, videography, coding and drone courses.</p><p><strong>Goal</strong>:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>To provide support for school events in both AVA and Photography services.</p></li><li><p>To explore photography as an art medium.</p></li></ul><p><strong>TIME AND DATE FOR THE CCA</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Thursday 3pm - 5pm</p></li><li><p>Duty Schedule (Mon - Sun - depending on activities/events that require support; rostered)</p></li></ul><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>NAME</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>DESIGNATION</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Koe Soon Guan</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Advisor</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mrs Ng-Kok Shu Ling</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Overall Teacher IC</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Sim Lye Eng </p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2nd Overall Teacher IC</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Kamarrudin</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher IC</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Ramar</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher IC</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>

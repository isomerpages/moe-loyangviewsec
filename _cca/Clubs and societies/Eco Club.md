<h4><strong>Our Mission &amp; Vision</strong></h4>
<p>At Loyang View Secondary School, the Eco Club is a passionate community
of students committed to protecting our environment and promoting sustainable
living.</p>
<p>We aim to nurture <em>environmentally conscious and socially responsible changemakers</em> who
understand that every small action counts towards a greener and cleaner
world.</p>
<p>Through hands-on learning, innovation, and community involvement, we strive
to inspire others to adopt sustainable habits and make positive contributions
to our planet.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Signature Programmes &amp; Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Our members engage in a range of meaningful and creative activities designed
to deepen their understanding of environmental issues and inspire change
in school and beyond.</p>
<p>🌱 Urban Farming, Farmers’ and Makers’ Market</p>
<p>Students cultivate vegetables and herbs in our school’s hydroponics system
and harvest them for sale at our annual Farmers’ and Makers’ Market.</p>
<p>The Farmers’ Market features fresh, home-grown produce from our urban
farm, while the Makers’ Market showcases students’ creativity through the
sale of upcycled crafts and pre-loved items.</p>
<p>Through these initiatives, students learn the values of sustainability,
entrepreneurship and compassion — as all proceeds are donated to charity
to support meaningful causes.</p>
<p>🚗 <strong>Green Wave Eco Racing Car Challenge</strong>
<br>Our team designed and raced eco-friendly model cars made from recycled
materials — clinching <strong>3rd Place</strong> in the <em>Pasir Ris-Punggol Greenwave Eco Racing Challenge</em>.</p>

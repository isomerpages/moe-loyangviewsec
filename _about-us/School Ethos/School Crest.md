*   **The school crest is a unique symbol of our identity as students and staff of Loyang View. It comprises three core elements**:

	*   **Three figures in an embrace** \- school, parents and students working hand in hand to achieve our school vision
	*   **Pixelated sun rays in the background** \- the rise of the digital age in the future
	*   **A tree that is made up of the three figures and the sun rays** \- continuous growth of skills and knowledge

  

*   **White symbolises purity and blue represents trust and responsibility**

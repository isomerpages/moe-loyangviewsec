Our Creed
-------------

##### ***I am unique and worthy.***

##### ***Within me lies the power to be the best that I can be. I look forward to each day with a sense of purpose; To be a wholesome individual with robust character; Willing to work hard, learn, and care for others.***

##### ***My future can be what I want it to be. With resilience I will succeed.***

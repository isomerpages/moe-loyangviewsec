Principal's Message
===================

At Loyang View, we are a Happy and Caring School. A special place where every student is developed into a wholesome individual with robust character and is well prepared for the skill force of tomorrow.  
  
We want our students to be able to thrive in an increasingly complex and ambiguous future. Character development, respect and discipline are hence the central tenets in our school’s educational philosophy. We aim to inculcate in every student a strong set of sound and enduring values, provide them with the moral compass to make the right choices in life, and to nurture them into resilient and contributing members of society.  
  
Beyond academic excellence, we also focus on providing our students with the necessary skills and competencies to succeed in the 21st century workplace. This means imbuing in them a passion for lifelong learning and equipping them with the relevant skillsets to do well far beyond their secondary school years.  
  
Together with our capable team of dedicated teachers and support staff, we will bring out the power in each and every student to be the best that he or she can be.  

  

Mr Eugene Lin  
Principal

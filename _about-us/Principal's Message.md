Principal's Message
===================

#### **Welcome to Loyang View Secondary School!**

At Loyang View Secondary, learning goes beyond the confines of textbooks and classrooms. We are a vibrant and caring community where students are nurtured to discover their passions, develop their strengths, and prepare themselves well for the future.

###### **Lifelong Learning**

The pace of change in the economy is accelerating and our students need to continue learning well beyond graduation. Our commitment to nurturing lifelong learners is evident in the curiosity, enthusiasm, and thirst for knowledge that our students display. We encourage them to question, explore, and embrace new challenges, knowing that learning is a lifelong pursuit. Our Stretch Programme and our Applied Learning Programme in Sustainability, give students the valuable opportunity to develop a mindset for self-directed lifelong learning and creative problem solving.

###### **Future-Ready Leaders**

Our school has always strived to mould students into future-ready leaders who are equipped to face the complexities of an ever-changing world. We empower them with critical thinking skills, leadership skills, and the ability to adapt to new situations. Our students are not just leaders in school today, they are learning to be leaders who can make a positive impact in their communities and beyond in the future. Besides the many student leadership positions we have trained our students to take up, we have also put in place a robust future-ready programme where students learn and experience the vast variety of career options that they can work towards, and thus make a better informed choice on their post-secondary school options.

###### **Active Citizens**

Citizenship is about actively participating in and contributing to our society. We instill in our students a sense of responsibility, compassion, and a desire to make a difference. Through our robust CCE and VIA programme, our students become active citizens who are committed to creating a better world. This can be seen from our Urban Farming programme which culminates in all harvested crops being sold at our biannual Farmers’ and Makers’ Market, with proceeds benefiting our designated charity.

###### **Passionate Educators and Committed Partners**

All our engaging programmes and outstanding student achievements would not be possible if not for the collective efforts and passion of our educators, the endearing support of our parent support group and School Advisory Committee, and the collective spirit of our alumni and school community. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all who have partnered us and contributed in big ways and small to the betterment of our students.

Together in Loyang View, we are shaping a brighter future—one where our students become lifelong learners, future-ready leaders, and active citizens.

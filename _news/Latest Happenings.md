### Commendation Day 2023

In celebration of the holistic achievements of our students from the 2022 cohort, this year’s Commendation Day theme was Aspire, Believe, Achieve. We believe that every student possesses the power to be the best that they can be. With diligence and drive, they can inspire one another to achieve their aspirations.  

It was inspiring to see so many students receive awards for their academic achievements, exemplary conduct and outstanding contributions to the school community. We are proud of all our students and their learning. Having parents and our SAC members with us to witness this special moment made the occasion even more meaningful. Congratulations to our students! We hope that this recognition will motivate them to continue reaching for greater heights!

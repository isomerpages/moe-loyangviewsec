<p>In celebration of the holistic achievements of our students from the 2022
cohort, this yearâ€™s Commendation Day theme was Aspire, Believe, Achieve.
We believe that every student possesses the power to be the best that they
can be. With diligence and drive, they can inspire one another to achieve
their aspirations.</p>
<p>It was inspiring to see so many students receive awards for their academic
achievements, exemplary conduct and outstanding contributions to the school
community. We are proud of all our students and their learning. Having
parents and our SAC members with us to witness this special moment made
the occasion even more meaningful. Congratulations to our students! We
hope that this recognition will motivate them to continue reaching for
greater heights!</p>

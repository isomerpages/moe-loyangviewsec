Singaporeans who are planning to go overseas for work or related concerns may reserve places for their children in the school under the Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme.

Upon their return to Singapore, the children can be readmitted directly to their schools.

Applicants are to submit the completed LOA Application Form using SGForms through the following link:
         **[https://form.gov.sg/67dd04a75c71914315c5e5f9](https://form.gov.sg/67dd04a75c71914315c5e5f9)**
		
Please contact the school for assistance if you have difficulty doing so.

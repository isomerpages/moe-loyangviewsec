<h1>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</h1>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen
their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction
of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary
school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed <strong>Personal Learning Device</strong> (PLD)
by end-2021.</p>
<p>With every student owning a PLD, teachers can enhance teaching and learning
through the design of ICT enriched learning experiences. Students will
be able to tap on digital resources to learn according to their needs and
interests and to collaborate with each other, anytime and anywhere. Students
will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of
Education (MOE)’s Digital Literacy Framework:</p>
<p>Loyang View Secondary School aims to develop&nbsp;learners:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;who are responsible users of technology</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;who are well-connected to the world</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with collaborative spirit</p>
<p><strong>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;who possess the necessary digital literacies to meet the challenges of the future</strong>
</p>
<h3><strong>Personal Learning Device (PLD) in LVSS</strong></h3>
<p>At LVSS, students use the Apple iPad as their PLD. It allows for a seamless
learning experience with existing teaching and learning technologies such
as the Singapore Student Learning Space, Microsoft 365 and Google Suite,
in addition to native Apple apps.</p>
<p>The iPad is a lightweight device that offers students convenient learning
on-the-move and is relatively easy to use. A full charge of the battery
typically allows students to use the iPad throughout the school day.</p>
<p>Each iPad comes bundled with the Apple Pencil and keyboard to maximise
the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool. The bundle also includes
3 years of AppleCare+ coverage and insurance.</p>

<p><strong>Why did the school choose the iPad as the PLD?</strong>
</p>
<p>Using the iPad in teaching and learning is not new to LVSS. We have been
tapping on the device for many years in our curriculum as well as enrichment
programmes. As such, it is natural to continue on this platform for the
familiarity of both students and teachers. The Google apps can also be
used on the iPad to facilitate learning.</p>

<h4><strong>Funding and Financial Assistance</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Use of Edusave</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens are able to use their Edusave accounts
to pay for the PLD.</p>
<p>A Singapore citizen student can use the available Edusave balance in his/her
Edusave account to pay for the PLD after setting aside provision for payment
of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees.</p>
<p>Alternatively, parents/guardians may choose to pay cash for the PLD. Please
note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after
subsidies have been granted.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Assistance</strong>
</p>
<p>Students under MOE FAS for the year will automatically be subsidised for
the PLD. For students on FAS, subsidies are available even if there is
insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket will be a maximum
of $50.</p>
<p>Financial assistance is also available for Permanent Residents (PR), International
Students (IS) and students who are currently&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;under
the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. Please contact the school at 6582
1727 or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:loyangview_ss@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">loyangview_ss@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;for
more information.</p>
<p><strong>Briefing for Parents</strong>
</p>
<p>An online briefing for parents was held in earlier on 12th Jan 2024 to
explain the details of the PLD.</p>
<p>A recording of the briefing and slides were forward to parents via Parents
Gateway.</p>
<p>Parents who missed the above, may email <a href="mailto:loyangview_ss@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">loyangview_ss@moe.edu.sg</a> for
the slides too.</p>

Parent Support Group @ LVSS
===========================

The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for us to be closer to our children, understand them better, and help them in their education journey. Our children also benefit when we are more active in their school environment.

They tend to:   
  
*   show more positive attitude  
    
*   have better school attendance and complete homework more consistently  
    
*   be able to bridge the cultural gap between school and home  
    
*   be less prone to behavioural issues

<b>We warmly invite parents to partner our  school and support our students by volunteering 3Ts.</b>
 

#### A) Time
You may wish to volunteer time to design and conduct the school’s programmes and events. Supportive PSG members can help to make the school a safe place for our children to learn in, making school life more vibrant and caring.

#### B) Talent
You can volunteer your expertise, talents, individual interests or personal networks. In this way, parents can significantly expand the pool of help available to the school and the PSG.

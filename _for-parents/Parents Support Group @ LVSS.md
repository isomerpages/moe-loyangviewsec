<h1>Parent Support Group @ LVSS</h1>
<h4><em>Supporting our children, together as a community</em></h4>
<p><strong>Why join PSG?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for us to be closer
to our children, understand them better, and help them in their education
journey. Our children also benefit when we are more active in their school
environment.</p>

<p><strong>We warmly invite parents to partner our&nbsp; school and support our students by volunteering 3Ts.</strong>

<h4>A) Time</h4>
<p>You may wish to volunteer time to design and conduct the school’s programmes
and events. Supportive PSG members can help to make the school a safe place
for our children to learn in, making school life more vibrant and caring.</p>

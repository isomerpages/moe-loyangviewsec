<h4><strong>Full Subject Based-Banding for Sec 1 and 2 [2024 onwards]</strong></h4>
<p>Throughout their secondary school education, students can take subjects
at three subject levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), mapped
from today's N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively. Students will
have the flexibility to adjust their subject levels at appropriate junctures,
based on their strengths, interests and learning needs. Students will subsequently
access programmes and post-secondary pathways based on their various subjects
and subject level combinations.</p>

<h4><strong>Subjects at More Demanding Level (MDL) for Lower Sec Cohort [2025 onwards]</strong></h4>
<p>We are pleased to inform parents that students who demonstrate strong
academic performance may be eligible to take subjects at a more demanding
level (e.g. from G1 to G2). This opportunity allows capable students to
further challenge themselves and reach their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will be considered for taking up MDL subjects if they achieve
75% or above in both:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The end-of-year examination for the relevant subject</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall results for the subject throughout the academic year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What This Means for Your Child</strong>
</p>
<p>Taking a subject at a more demanding level provides students with greater
academic rigour and can better prepare them for their future educational
pathways.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong>
</p>
<p>If your child meets the eligibility requirements, the school will issue
a letter of offer through your child's form teacher. This letter will provide
details about the available options and guidance on making an informed
decision that best supports your child's academic journey.</p>

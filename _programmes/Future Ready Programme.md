### Future-Ready Programme


Future-Ready Programme is a specially organised 3-day programme for our graduating classes. It is designed to equip our students with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in a rapidly changing world. This programme focuses on developing the following key competencies:

**Critical Thinking:**  The ability to analyze information, make sound judgements and decisions, and solve complex problems.

**Creativity:**  The ability to think outside the box, generate new ideas and approaches, and innovate.


**Collaboration:** The ability to work effectively with others, build consensus, and communicate clearly and respectfully.

**Communication:** The ability to express ideas clearly and effectively, both verbally and in writing, and to use digital tools and media to communicate with diverse audiences.

**Digital literacy:** The ability to use digital technologies and tools effectively and responsibly, including coding, data analysis, and cybersecurity.

**Global awareness**: The ability to understand and appreciate different cultures, perspectives, and experiences, and to work collaboratively across boundaries.

As part of this programme, students will undergo a range of learning experiences to equip them with the relevant knowledge and skills in their exploration of educational pathways and future career options.Â  They will visit tertiary institutions and hear from invited guest speakers from a range of industry sectors, including healthcare, digital and engineering to speak with our students. In addition, students will also have an opportunity to visit an organisation of their choice based on their preferred career sector. This is to help our students better understand the day-to-day operations and learn about the specific skills and knowledge required in their preferred career sectors.

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Urban Farming is a signature programme aligned to our efforts in ‘Growing
Character’.</p>
<p>Our Sec 2 students are provided with some basic training on tending to
the vegetable garden which includes planting, weeding and harvesting. The
students are also made aware of the challenges of food sustainability and
benefits of organic food. With this knowledge and conviction to serve,
they tend to the vegetable plots, regularly water the plants, as well as
care which also develops values like responsibility and resilience in our
students.</p>

<p>After a period of regular, consistent care for this vegetation, the crops
are then harvested. Our students take time to pack these harvested vegetables,
together with a team of teachers and think of innovative marketing techniques
to sell these organic produce to their schoolmates in an organised platform;
Farmers’ &amp; Makers’ Market. Spurred on by their passion to serve, the
students’ entrepreneurial spirit is also honed as they think of various
ways to market and promote the sales of these crops such that it benefits
the consumers and adequate funds are raised for charity. Some of the innovative
ideas are premix packs, organic facial packs and use of online platforms.
The sales proceeds are then donated to a select beneficiary like Cerebral
Palsy Alliance Singapore.

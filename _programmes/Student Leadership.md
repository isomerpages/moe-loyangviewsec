### Student Leadership in Loyang View
---------------------------------

Our vision for Student Leadership is to develop confident and self-directed student leaders with a passion to lead and serve. Through different platforms, opportunities are provided for student leaders to develop and demonstrate their competencies.    

Student Leadership in LVSS comprises of

*   Student Councillors
*   Class Leaders
*   CCA Leaders

**The Student Council** works closely with various stakeholders to foster the happy and caring culture in the school. They are guided by 5 practices of exemplary leadership according to the Student Leadership Challenge Model by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner. Student Councillors develop and hone their leadership skills throughout the year with their involvement in school events, projects and functions. They serve as advocates for school-directed programmes and lead student-initiated activities. As ambassadors of the school, they serve with passion to represent the student body in various platforms.

**Class Leaders** are formally appointed by form teachers to lead and serve in their classes. Their role is to foster a positive culture in their respective classes. Leadership training workshops on how to build a caring class community are conducted to equip them with practical knowledge. Class leaders are given opportunities to design and implement rapport-building activities for their classes throughout the year.

**CCA Leaders** are formally appointed by CCA teachers to lead and serve in their CCAs. Their role is to strengthen culture and strive for excellence in their CCA.  CCA leaders are given continuous coaching by their CCA teachers and mentors. They work closely with CCA teachers to plan, implement and lead training programmes.

These are some of the programmes and activities the Student Leaders in LV have been actively involved in:

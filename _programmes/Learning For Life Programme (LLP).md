Learning For Life Programme (LLP)
=================================

### Sports and Outdoor Education
----------------------------


Our Learning for Life (LLP) Programme provides opportunities aimed at nurturing students’ resilience – to persevere through challenges and thrive confidently. Through various sports, physical, and outdoor activities, students are developed holistically, leading active and purposeful lives.

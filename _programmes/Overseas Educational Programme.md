Overseas Educational Programme
==============================

With the emphasis on developing 21st Century Competencies in our students and to create an internationalisation experience for our students, Loyang View Secondary School organises trips to various countries as part of our signature Overseas Educational Program (OEP) for all Secondary 3 students.  

The key objectives are:     

*   To prepare the students for the challenges of a globalised world by creating opportunities for them to be exposed to different cultures and the global environment
*   To promote passion for learning and develop social confidence of individual through cultural exposure
*   To deepen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore

These trips had taken our students to Australia, China, Kuantan, Selangor, Thailand and Vietnam.

This unique experience provides the opportunity for every Secondary 3 student to raise their awareness of the place Singapore has in the world, deepening students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

<h1>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</h1>
<h1>Programme Philosophy</h1>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) helps students develop STEM skills
through design-based science activities. Focused on sustainability and
aligned with the United Nation's Affordable and Clean Energy goal, students
use the Design Thinking framework to solve problems and collaborate with
stakeholders to create sustainable solutions.</p>
<h1>Signature Programmes</h1>
<p><u>Sec 1 Design &amp; Engineering </u>
<br>Students learn about science &amp; engineering concepts by conducting
hands-on experiments to design and fabricate solar cars for children.
<br>The cars are built using recycled materials to promote less waste and
sustainability of resources.
<br>The students then participate in a race to determine the fastest solar
car.</p>

<p><u>Sec 2 Design &amp; Engineering</u>
<br>Students learn about different types of clean energy sources through a
series of hands-on investigations. Thereafter, they apply their knowledge
to design and fabricate a gadget to solve real world issues on sustainability.</p>
<p>Their gadgets are built using recycled materials and are powered by clean
energy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Sec 3 Applied Science Enrichment</u>
<br>Students explore and deepen their interest in various STEM-related fields
of their choice.</p>
<p>In addition to learning new skills, the programme encourages our students
to think creatively and critically as they showcase their learning that
aims to solve real-world issues.</p>
<p>Students also go on learning journeys where they get to interact with
industrial experts and see how they work.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Sec 3 James Dyson Foundation Programme</u>
<br>In collaboration with James Dyson Foundation, students explore how engineers
can solve global challenges, focusing on air pollution.</p>
<p>Students also interact with engineers from Dyson, learning about the life
of an engineer and processes involved in prototyping solutions.</p>

<p><u>STEM Playground</u>
<br>STEM Playground is a competition organised by MOE’s Curriculum Planning
and Development Division, Singapore Science Centre and James Dyson Foundation
to encourage students’ interest, curiosity and creativity in STEM activities.</p>
<p>At LVSS, all Sec 1 and 2 students have the opportunity to participate
in this competition.</p>

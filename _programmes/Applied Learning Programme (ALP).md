Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
================================

  

### APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME (ALP) - SUSTAINABILITY


Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides our students with the opportunity to delve into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields while applying design-thinking skills to solve real-world issues. Through the engaging activities, we seek to cultivate a scientific mindset in our students.   

Sustainability is the key theme of our programme. Our students, as future-ready and active citizens, partake in discussions and experiences with peers, teachers and industry partners as they strive to keep Singapore sustainable for our future, in line with one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals – Affordable and Clean Energy. 

Sustainability is the key theme of our programme, as we seek to instill mindset of keeping Singapore sustainable for our future generations. The activities designed aim to be in line with one of United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals – **Affordable and Clean Energy**.

Students make use of the Design Thinking framework and learn to solve problems using scientific knowledge. They collaborate and communicate with different stakeholders such as school, family and community as well as engineer solutions that add value and seek to solve problems in these areas.

All these are accomplished through design-based science activities that the ALP Committee and Science Department has collaboratively crafted with STEM Inc.

Schools Challenge - Live Smart @ The East is a STEM-focused social innovation programme for lower secondary students. The programme aims to broaden students' interest and learning of various STEM disciplines, encouraging them to co-create innovative and practical solutions that improve the living environment for residents in the east and help to transform the east into a pioneer Smart City in Singapore. Throughout the programme, each student team was mentored by business volunteers from JP Morgan and supported by SUTD student leaders.

Over the 5-month period, the groups thought of innovative solutions to problems that were surfaced by interviewees. Some innovations included automated dustbins that could close shutters and alert cleaning crew when they were full to prevent overflowing bins at community areas, role-playing games to immerse and educate players about local culture and also a smart device to remind the elderly to consume medication on time.

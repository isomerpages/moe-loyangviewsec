<p>Each year, all Secondary Two students embark on an exciting quest to tackle
a unique challenge designed by Science teachers. With a new challenge each
year, students have the opportunity to engage in creative problem-solving
and practical application of scientific principles. As students work together
to devise and implement their solutions, they not only showcase their creativity
but also gain a deeper understanding of the scientific concepts that underpin
their designs, while acquiring skills in innovation, teamwork and effective

<h1>Level Sports Carnivals</h1>
<p>Our Sports Carnivals aim to inspire students to excel in sports games
taught during PE lessons, while enhancing teamwork and class camaraderie
through inter-class competitions. These competitions encourage personal
growth, collaboration and a strong sense of class camaraderie.</p>

<h1>Cross Country Meet</h1>
<p>Our annual Cross Country Meet aims to promote endurance, resilience and
appreciation for physical fitness in an outdoor setting. It encourages
students to challenge themselves, set personal goals and embrace the benefits
of outdoor activities. Through collaboration with our Parent Support Group
and alumni, this event also fosters school unity and community spirit as
students support one another in achieving their best in an outdoor environment.</p>

<h1>Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camps</h1>
<p>Our Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camps provide learning experiences
that cannot be replicated in the classroom. They offer authentic contexts
in which students apply what they have learnt from Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) and Outdoor Education in Physical Education (OE in PE)
lessons. The richness and complexity of these experiences, such as working
with their peers to overcome challenges or navigating in a new environment
during a journey, allow them to extend and deepen their learning from the
classroom into real life.</p>

<h1>Poetry Slam</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As an extension of the Secondary One English Language and Literature curriculum,
all Secondary One students participate in the Poetry Slam programme to
compose and perform original poems of their own. The programme culminates
in an exciting inter-class Poetry Slam competition where students combine
creativity in language use with stage performance.</p>

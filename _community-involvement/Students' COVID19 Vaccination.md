Students' COVID-19 Vaccination
==============================

### COVID-19 Vaccination Exercise for Students in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Parents/Guardians,    
  
MOE is commencing COVID-19 vaccination for students in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning as part of the national vaccination exercise.     
  
From 1 June, parents/guardians of students taking their GCE N-, O- or A-Level examinations this year will receive the SMS invites to schedule students’ vaccination appointments. Parents/guardians of all other eligible students aged 12 and above will receive the SMS invites over the next two weeks. Parental/guardian consent is required for students below the age of 18 when booking vaccination appointments via the National Appointment System. Parents/guardians of students aged 13 and above are not required to accompany their child/ward for the vaccination.    
  
While the COVID-19 vaccination is not mandatory, we would like to encourage all medically eligible students to be vaccinated when the vaccine is made available to them and to register for a vaccination slot early. Do consult your child’s/ward’s doctor if your child/ward has underlying medical conditions that might affect their medical eligibility. You may read the attached Parent Kit and Info Sheet or click on the link to the Press Release for more information.    
  
MOE will be organising webinars on 1 June (5pm– 6pm) and 3 June (12pm – 1 pm) to address questions you may have regarding the vaccination exercise for students. The webinars will feature an MOH medical expert and MOE representatives. The webinar link is attached below.   You may share your questions with us before the webinars via the link to the survey form. Due to the limited capacity of the webinars (3000pax), attendees will be admitted on a first-come first-served basis. Video snippets from the webinar will be uploaded online after the sessions. The webinar link can be found below.
